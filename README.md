## Abstact 
The principle and function of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is to radiate the sample with X-rays, causing the inner electrons or valence electrons of atoms or molecules to be excited out. Electrons excited by photons are called photoelectrons. The energy of photoelectrons can be measured. With the kinetic energy of photoelectrons,(Eb=hv light energy -Ek kinetic energy -W work function) as the horizontal coordinate and the relative intensity (pulse /s) as the ordinate, the photoelectron spectra can be made. To obtain information about the sample. However, the total spectrum can only be obtain from experiment datas. Gaussian distribution and Doniach–Sunić(DS) distribution can effective describ the XPS spectrum. In this project, we will use Gaussian and DS function to describ the Mg(10-10) surface XPS spectrum by python.
## How to run the notebook
1. Install the Annoconda.
2. Oprate the anaconda prompt and type conda env create -f environment.yml and activate it.
3. Run the Jupyter.
4. Install and activate the environment described by the file environment.yml by running the following in a terminal.(in the environment.yml)

## Experiment datas
In same path, 5.txt is x(energy) and 6.txt is density.
